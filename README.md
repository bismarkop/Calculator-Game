## Features
* Basic calculator
* A 60 second math game that allows you to use the calculator to solve problems
* Flashing numbers to distract the user during the game

## Calculator
* Needed Improvements
  * Display screen isn't limited to what's displayed - Numbers entered on the display screen after "0123456789" continue so that any number being deleted after 9 make it appear as if the delete button isnt working
  * If the display is empty, pressing "=" shows undefined
